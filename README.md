# NestJS and React Native OAuth Authentication System

## Overview

This project demonstrates an OAuth-based authentication system using NestJS for the backend and React Native for the mobile application. The backend handles the authentication logic, leveraging Google OAuth for user authentication. The React Native app provides the user interface for signing in and viewing profile information.

## Features

-   Google OAuth-based authentication
-   Secure token storage and retrieval
-   User profile management
-   Logout functionality

-   Passport.js: A popular authentication middleware for Node.js.
-   JWT: JSON Web Tokens for secure token-based authentication.
-   Prima: A Node.js and TypeScript ORM.
-   SQLite: To store the user data

### Frontend
